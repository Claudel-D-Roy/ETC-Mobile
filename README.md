# Final Course Project - Mobile

Project completed during the fifth session of my software development program.

This is the end-of-session project, a mobile application in Flutter.

## Specifications:

Your application must have one main feature and two secondary features.

You should have at least two categories of users (with different roles) with different permissions. The choice of the database (and any other technological choices, such as the types of sensors used (GPS, accelerometers, etc.)) is at your discretion.
